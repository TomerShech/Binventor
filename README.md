# [Binventor](https://binventor.com/)

**Binventor** is a text pasting web app that aims for simple & easy sharing of code snippets.
I started making it as a personal project for myself, in order to improve my web skills.
Then, I got into the Computer Science class at my high school, so I chose to put it online for my class to use.
If you are some random internet person who deliberately/accidentally got here, don't worry, my auto-non-cs-class-person-detector will find & eliminate you!

## Features:

- Manually choosing your code's programming language? no need! Binventor will automatically highlight it for you. (Thanks highlight.js!)

- **Protip:** name your paste with the extension of its language to force the highlighting of that language.
e.g. A paste name *"script.ts"* will make sure your code is highlighted as TypeScript and not as JavaScript!


- No more ugliness or unresponsive design! (Forgive me, Pastebin), Binventor is built with modern standards in mind.

- Your pastes will be deleted ONLY when you want them to. Select the expiration time you think is best.

- Use the keyboard shortcuts you're already familiar with, or, you know.. the regular buttons.


If using a computer, you can use _**CTRL + S**_ to save & get a shareable link, no need to use the button!
